# View Your Trip
 
This is a Django based application secured with otp verification. At the backend, it uses linear regression in order to predict the amount to be spent on means of transport by the user according to overall budget of the trip. At this moment of time there are two means of transport - flights and trains. The data is extracted with the help of Selenium webdriver and Beautiful soup. 

To run the project, install all the libraries.
